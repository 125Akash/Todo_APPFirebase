# Todo App with Next.js and Firebase

## Overview

This project is a simple Todo application built using Next.js for the frontend and Firebase for authentication and real-time data storage. It allows users to create, update, and delete tasks in real-time.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Firebase authentication is integrated to secure the application.
